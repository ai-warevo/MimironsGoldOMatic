# Mimiron's Gold-o-Matic — Interaction Scenarios & Test Cases

This document translates **`docs/SPEC.md`** and related product docs into **interaction scenarios (SC-)** and **test cases (TC-)**. It does **not** invent behavior beyond those sources. **Gold is not paid on enroll:** **subscribers** join via **`!twgold <CharacterName>`** in **broadcast chat**; a **roulette** selects an **online-verified** winner; **WoW whisper reply `!twgold`** (after the **winner notification whisper**, `docs/SPEC.md` §9) leads the addon to print **`[MGM_ACCEPT:UUID]`** → Desktop **`confirm-acceptance`**; **`[MGM_CONFIRM:UUID]`** in **`WoWChatLog.txt`** drives **`Sent`** and **removes** the winner from the pool.

**References:** `README.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/SPEC.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`, `docs/UI_SPEC.md` (screen-level UX aligned to these flows), component `ReadME.md` files under `docs/MimironsGoldOMatic.*/`.

## Part 1 — Component Interaction Scenarios

### SC-001: Viewer obtains gold successfully (full end-to-end)

**Trigger:** Viewer is a **subscriber**, sends **`!twgold Norinn`** in **broadcast chat**, and later roulette selects them as **online-verified** winner; they **`!twgold`** in **WoW** (whisper reply) to consent and receive mail.

**Actor:** Viewer (Twitch + WoW), Streamer (WoW + Desktop), System (Backend chat + spin/schedule)

**Preconditions:** Backend reachable; chat ingestion active; viewer **subscribed**; **`CharacterName`** **unique** in pool; pool has ≥1 participant; Extension authorized for status UI (MVP: Dev Rig posture); Desktop eventually online with correct `ApiKey`; WoW 3.3.5a running (foreground for MVP).

**Flow:**

1. [Viewer] → [Twitch Chat]: `!twgold Norinn` | [ChatIngest] → [Backend]: enroll subscriber with **unique** name
2. [Backend] → [Backend]: persist **pool enrollment**; no `Pending` payout yet (`docs/SPEC.md` §5)
3. [System] → [Backend]: spin fires on **5-minute** schedule (UTC **:00/:05/…**); candidate drawn; **`currentSpinCycleId`** issued (`docs/SPEC.md` §5.1)
4. [WoWAddon] → [WoW Client]: run **`/who Norinn`**; parse **3.3.5a** result → **`DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage`** **`[MGM_WHO]{...json}`** → **`Logs\WoWChatLog.txt`** (`docs/SPEC.md` §8) | [Desktop] tails log → **`POST /api/roulette/verify-candidate`** (`X-MGM-ApiKey`)
5. [Backend] → [Backend]: if **`online: true`**, create **payout** `Pending`; else **no winner** this cycle (**no** re-draw); expose state for Extension when **`Pending`** exists (**winner notification**)
6. [TwitchExtension] → [Viewer]: **“You won”** + instruct **WoW whisper reply `!twgold`** (`docs/SPEC.md` §11)
7. [Desktop] → [WoW Client]: inject **`/run NotifyWinnerWhisper("<payoutId>","Norinn")`** (`docs/SPEC.md` §8–9) → [WoWAddon] sends **winner notification whisper** (`/whisper Norinn …` Russian text per §9; **addon-only** typing)
8. [Viewer/WoW] → [Streamer/WoW]: whisper reply matching **`!twgold`** (**case-insensitive**)
9. [WoWAddon] → [WoW Chat Log]: print `[MGM_ACCEPT:<uuid>]` → [Desktop] tails `WoWChatLog.txt` | [Desktop] → [Backend]: `POST /api/payouts/{id}/confirm-acceptance`
10. [Desktop] → [Backend]: `GET /api/payouts/pending` → streamer **Sync/Inject**
11. [Desktop] → [Backend]: `PATCH /api/payouts/{id}/status` `{ "status": "InProgress" }`
12. [Desktop] → [WoW Client]: WinAPI **PostMessage** / **SendInput** fallback: `/run ReceiveGold("<chunked payload>")` \<255 chars per line (`docs/SPEC.md` §8)
13. [WoW Client] → [WoWAddon]: Lua `ReceiveGold(dataString)`; queue `MAIL_SHOW` UX; streamer sends mail (1000g = 10000000 copper)
14. [WoWAddon] → [WoW Chat Log]: print `[MGM_CONFIRM:<uuid>]` → appears in `Logs\WoWChatLog.txt`
15. [Desktop] → [Backend]: tail log → `PATCH /api/payouts/{id}/status` `{ "status": "Sent" }` → **remove winner from pool**

**Postconditions:** Payout `Sent`; winner **removed** from participant pool; pool row may be re-added later via **`!twgold <CharacterName>`**; viewer sees status in Extension.

**Failure exits:** enrollment rejected (not subscribed, duplicate **character name** in pool, cap, invalid name); **offline at `/who`** (**no winner** this cycle — **no** re-draw); missing **WoW whisper `!twgold`** consent; injection or mail failure; log never shows `MGM_CONFIRM`; API down at any HTTP step.

---

### SC-002: Streamer authenticates the WPF Desktop App against the API

**Trigger:** Streamer starts Desktop and connects to Backend.

**Actor:** Streamer

**Preconditions:** Backend configured with expected `X-MGM-ApiKey`; Desktop stores same secret.

**Flow:**

1. [Desktop] → [Backend]: first privileged call e.g. `GET /api/payouts/pending` | headers: `X-MGM-ApiKey: <secret>`
2. [Backend] → [Desktop]: `200 OK` + JSON list (may be empty) | or error if key invalid

**Postconditions:** Desktop can poll/patch payout APIs.

**Failure exits:** wrong/missing key → `403` `forbidden_apikey` (per `docs/SPEC.md` §5 error model); network failure.

---

### SC-003: WPF App connects to a running WoW 3.3.5a client via WinAPI

**Trigger:** Streamer launches Desktop with WoW already running (MVP: **foreground** `WoW.exe`).

**Actor:** Streamer

**Preconditions:** `WoW.exe` process present; Desktop has permission to use Win32 APIs.

**Flow:**

1. [Desktop] → [OS]: enumerate / find foreground WoW window (implementation-specific; e.g. `FindWindow`, `GetForegroundWindow`, process name `WoW.exe`)
2. [Desktop] → [WoW Client]: **PostMessage** (primary) to game input with `/run ...` or `/who ...` text path; **SendInput** if fallback selected

**Postconditions:** Desktop can inject chat commands reliably enough for MVP (`docs/SPEC.md` §8).

**Failure exits:** WoW not running; wrong window focused; anti-cheat blocking PostMessage; injection timing/focus failure.

---

### SC-004: WoW Addon confirms gold delivery via in-game mail and reports back

**Trigger:** Streamer completes **Send Mail** in UI after `ReceiveGold` populated fields.

**Actor:** Streamer (in-game)

**Preconditions:** Mailbox open; addon queued payout; recipient accepted per product flow (`!twgold` already processed); gold available.

**Flow:**

1. [WoWAddon] → [Mail UI]: `SendMailNameEditBox`, subject, `MoneyInputFrame_SetCopper` (3.3.5a)
2. [WoW Client]: mail sent to server
3. [WoWAddon] → [Chat / WoWChatLog]: **`[MGM_CONFIRM:<payoutGuid>]`** (required for automated `Sent`)
4. [Desktop] → [Backend]: observes log line → `PATCH` → `Sent`

**Postconditions:** Backend `Sent`; audit log shows mail-send confirmation path.

**Failure exits:** mailbox closed; insufficient gold; invalid recipient; addon does not emit tag; Desktop misses log rotation.

---

### SC-010: API receives enrollment / spin updates but WPF Desktop App is offline

**Trigger:** Viewers enroll; Backend creates `Pending` winner payout; Desktop not running.

**Actor:** System / Viewer

**Preconditions:** Backend up; Desktop down or not polling.

**Flow:**

1. [TwitchExtension] → [Backend]: enroll + spin flows complete → `Pending` payout exists
2. [Backend] → [Desktop]: **no** poll — queue grows in DB only

**Postconditions:** Payouts stay `Pending` until Desktop polls or **hourly job** may later `Expired` if >24h (`docs/SPEC.md` §7).

**Failure exits:** streamer cannot inject until Desktop online; viewer stuck waiting past UX expectations (product issue, not separate error code in spec).

---

### SC-011: WPF App is running but WoW client process is not found

**Trigger:** Streamer clicks **Sync/Inject** or `/who` automation runs without WoW.

**Actor:** Streamer

**Preconditions:** Desktop authenticated; no `WoW.exe` / no target window.

**Flow:**

1. [Desktop] → [OS]: locate WoW → **fails**
2. [Desktop] → [Desktop]: UI state “Searching for WoW” / error; **no** successful `PostMessage`

**Postconditions:** No injection; payout remains **`Pending`** (Desktop **must not** `PATCH` to **`InProgress`** until WoW is detected — `docs/SPEC.md` §3).

**Failure exits:** user never launches WoW; wrong client build.

> **Resolution (product):** Desktop **must not** transition **`Pending` → `InProgress`** until the WoW client target is found (`docs/SPEC.md` §3).

---

### SC-012: WoW character name in the request does not exist on the realm

**Trigger:** Viewer submits enrollment with a name that is not a real character on the streamer’s realm/faction context.

**Actor:** Viewer

**Preconditions:** Backend validates **format** (shared validation). MVP does **not** call external realm/Armory APIs.

**Flow:**

1. [TwitchExtension] → [Backend]: `POST /api/payouts/claim` with bogus name (format-valid)
2. [Backend] → [Backend]: may accept enrollment if only regex rules apply (`docs/SPEC.md` §4, §5)
3. At **spin / win** time, **`/who <Name>`** in-game is the **online / presence** check (`docs/SPEC.md` glossary). A non-existent name will typically fail **`/who`** / mail UX; otherwise streamer uses **manual** fail path (`Failed`) (faction/manual handling).

**Postconditions:** Possible **enrollment** stored; payout delivery may hit **Failed** in Desktop or streamer correction.

**Failure exits:** mail cannot be delivered to non-existent toon; addon/mail API errors.

> **Resolution (product):** No separate “realm database” lookup in MVP. **In-game `/who`** is the normative check when a candidate winner is evaluated; enrollment remains **format + pool rules** only.

---

### SC-013: Duplicate gold request for the same viewer within cooldown window

**Trigger:** Same viewer repeats enroll submit or rapid duplicate HTTP calls before rate limit window elapses.

**Actor:** Viewer / network retry

**Preconditions:** Existing enrollment for same `EnrollmentRequestId` or active payout per user.

**Flow (idempotent enroll):** [TwitchExtension] → [Backend]: duplicate `enrollmentRequestId` → `200 OK` same enrollment (`docs/SPEC.md` §4).

**Flow (rate limit):** burst of requests → `429` or server rate-limit response (ASP.NET Core rate limiter ~5/min per SPEC).

**Flow (active payout):** second **winner** payout while one **active** → `409`-style error body e.g. `active_payout_exists` (`docs/SPEC.md` §5).

**Postconditions:** No double-spend via same enrollment request id; abuse bounded by rate limit.

**Failure exits:** client mishandles idempotent `200` vs `201`.

---

### SC-014: Twitch token validation fails on the API side

**Trigger:** Extension calls Backend with missing/invalid/expired Twitch JWT.

**Actor:** Viewer

**Preconditions:** Backend validates **real Twitch-issued** Extension JWTs (**Dev Rig** and deploy — `docs/SPEC.md` deployment scope).

**Flow:**

1. [TwitchExtension] → [Backend]: `POST /api/payouts/claim` with bad `Authorization: Bearer …`
2. [Backend] → [TwitchExtension]: `401 unauthorized` | body: `{ "code": "unauthorized", … }` (recommended shape §5)

**Postconditions:** No pool write.

**Failure exits:** clock skew; wrong extension secret; Dev Rig misconfiguration.

---

### SC-015: WoW Addon fails to send mail (mailbox not open / target unreachable)

**Trigger:** Stream triggers mail send while mailbox closed, bad recipient, or insufficient gold.

**Actor:** Streamer

**Preconditions:** Payout `InProgress`; addon queue has entry.

**Flow:**

1. [WoWAddon] wrapper rejects send → **no** `MGM_CONFIRM` line
2. [Desktop]: no `Sent` from automation
3. [Streamer] → [Desktop]: **Mark as Failed** or retry after fixing (`docs/SPEC.md` transitions allow `Failed`)

**Postconditions:** Payout `Failed` or remains `InProgress` until operator acts.

**Failure exits:** silent addon bug; duplicate send attempts (state machine should prevent per WoWAddon ReadME).

---

### SC-016: API request queue overflow (too many concurrent requests)

**Trigger:** Many Extensions or bots hit API above configured limits.

**Actor:** External clients

**Preconditions:** Rate limiter / server max concurrency configured.

**Flow:**

1. [Clients] → [Backend]: burst HTTP
2. [Backend] → [Clients]: `429 Too Many Requests` or server-defined throttling (ASP.NET rate limiting per SPEC ~5 req/min per IP/user)

**Postconditions:** No unbounded queue assumed in docs—**reject or delay** per implementation.

**Failure exits:** DDoS beyond app layer; DB overload not detailed in MVP docs.

**Resolution:** Global saturation may yield **`503`**; Extension backoff + Retry per **`docs/SPEC.md` §5** error model and **§5.1**. Per-user **`429`** remains ~5 req/min target.

---

### SC-017: WPF App loses connection to API mid-session

**Trigger:** Network drop during poll, PATCH, or confirm calls.

**Actor:** System

**Preconditions:** Desktop mid-flow (e.g. after addon signaled `!twgold` locally).

**Flow:**

1. [Desktop] → [Backend]: `GET /api/payouts/pending` → **IOException / timeout**
2. [Desktop]: Polly retry/backoff (per Desktop ReadME); surfaced in UI

**Postconditions:** Eventually consistent if retries succeed; operator may use overrides.

**Failure exits:** prolonged outage → stale `InProgress`; missed **`MGM_CONFIRM`** sync until back online.

---

### SC-020: Streamer pauses/resumes gold distribution

**Trigger:** Streamer wants to temporarily stop processing payouts.

**Actor:** Streamer

**Preconditions:** None defined in SPEC for a **pause** flag.

**Flow:**

> **Resolved for MVP:** `docs/SPEC.md` — **pause/resume** is **not** in MVP; streamer stops by workflow only.

**Postconditions (conceptual):** Future spec may add a pause flag; until then, operator-only.


**Failure exits:** N/A until specified.

---

### SC-021: Streamer manually cancels a pending request

**Trigger:** Streamer chooses cancel in Desktop for a `Pending` (or allowed state) payout.

**Actor:** Streamer

**Preconditions:** Payout in `Pending` (or as allowed by transition table §3).

**Flow:**

1. [Desktop] → [Backend]: `PATCH /api/payouts/{id}/status` `{ "status": "Cancelled" }` + `X-MGM-ApiKey`

**Postconditions:** Payout `Cancelled` (terminal for operator purpose per lifecycle).

**Failure exits:** illegal transition → `terminal_status_change_not_allowed`; wrong id → `404`.

---

### SC-022: System retries a failed delivery attempt

**Trigger:** First injection or mail attempt failed; streamer retries.

**Actor:** Streamer / Desktop

**Preconditions:** Payout `InProgress` or returned to operable state per policy.

**Flow:**

1. [Desktop] → [WoW Client]: re-issue `/run ReceiveGold("...")` after fixing root cause **or** streamer completes mail manually with addon still emitting `MGM_CONFIRM`

**Postconditions:** `MGM_CONFIRM` observed → `Sent`.

**Failure exits:** double payout if state machine buggy (mitigated by single active payout rule).

> ⚠️ **OPEN QUESTION:** Whether Backend supports explicit “retry token” or only operator-driven re-inject is not specified; tests assume **idempotent inject** for same payout id on client side.

---

## Part 2 — Test Cases

### TC-001: E2E — Pool to Sent (happy path)

**Covers:** SC-001

**Component under test:** E2E (TwitchExtension + Backend + Desktop + WoWAddon)

**Type:** E2E

**Preconditions:**

- Test Backend URL; valid `ApiKey`; Dev Rig JWT or mocks; WoW test client with addon; Desktop test build; clearing known payout rows for test Twitch user.

**Input:**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| characterName | Norinn |
| enrollmentRequestId | 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000 |
| twitchUserId | 90001337 |
| goldAmount (winner payout) | 1000g (10000000 copper) |

**Steps:**

1. Simulate chat **`!twgold Norinn`** → pool enroll **or** Extension `POST /api/payouts/claim` → `201`
2. Simulate/trigger spin + `/who` success (test hook or scripted Desktop)
3. Assert Backend has `Pending` payout for Norinn
4. Extension shows winner UX; simulate **WoW whisper `!twgold`** → Desktop `confirm-acceptance` → success
6. Desktop `PATCH InProgress`, inject `ReceiveGold`, complete mail in-game
7. Assert `WoWChatLog.txt` contains `[MGM_CONFIRM:<id>]`
8. Desktop `PATCH Sent`

**Expected Result:**

| Assertion | Expected Value |
|-----------|----------------|
| Final GET payout status | `Sent` |
| HTTP PATCH last call | `200` |
| confirm-acceptance | `200`; `WinnerAcceptedWillingToReceiveAt` set in read model (if exposed) |

**Expected Side Effects:**

- Marten events appended; read model updated; optional Polly retries on transient failures (no unbounded loops).

**Notes:** 3.3.5a **`MAIL_SHOW`** / whisper event names must match addon; E2E may be split into **stubs** for `/who` parsing.

---

| Assertion | Expected Value |
|-----------|----------------|
| `Pending` payout for this spin | **not** created (or spin re-issues per policy) |
| Extension | no “You won” for loser of invalid draw |

**Expected Side Effects:**

- No **`Pending`** payout created for this spin cycle; pool unchanged until next scheduled spin.

**Notes:** **`docs/SPEC.md`** — **no re-draw** in the same **5-minute** cycle; no second candidate pick.

## Component Contracts

Summary of **documented** boundaries. Pool/spin polling routes are defined in **`docs/SPEC.md` §5.1**.

### Twitch Extension → ASP.NET Core API

| Direction | Message/Endpoint | Payload shape | Success response | Failure response |
|-----------|------------------|---------------|------------------|------------------|
| Extension → API | `POST /api/payouts/claim` (optional) | `{ "characterName": string, "enrollmentRequestId": string }` + Twitch JWT (subscriber verified server-side) | `201 Created` (new enroll) or `200 OK` (idempotent) | `400` `invalid_character_name`; `401` `unauthorized`; `403`/`400` if not subscribed; `409`/`400` `character_name_taken_in_pool`; `429` rate limit; cap errors e.g. `lifetime_cap_reached` |
| Chat → Backend | `!twgold <CharacterName>` | **EventSub** `channel.chat.message` (MVP) | pool enroll / replace per `docs/SPEC.md` §5 | domain errors per `docs/SPEC.md` §5 |
| Extension → API | `GET /api/payouts/my-last` | Twitch Extension **JWT** (Bearer) | `200` + **`PayoutDto`** | **`404`** when no winner payout |
| Extension → API | `GET /api/roulette/state` | Twitch Extension **JWT** | `200` + schedule + **`spinPhase`** enum + optional **`currentSpinCycleId`** (`docs/SPEC.md` §5.1) | `401`, `429`, domain errors |
| Extension → API | `GET /api/pool/me` | Twitch Extension **JWT** | `200` + enrollment hint | `401`, `429` |
| API → Extension | (pull only in MVP) | — | Extension polls for **winner notification** / status | Error boundary UI per TwitchExtension ReadME |

### ASP.NET Core API → WPF Desktop App

| Direction | Message/Endpoint | Payload shape | Success response | Failure response |
|-----------|------------------|---------------|------------------|------------------|
| API ← Desktop | `GET /api/payouts/pending` | header `X-MGM-ApiKey` | `200` JSON list of **winner** payouts (`Pending` primary) | `403` `forbidden_apikey` |
| API ← Desktop | `POST /api/roulette/verify-candidate` | JSON from **`[MGM_WHO]`** line + `X-MGM-ApiKey` (`docs/SPEC.md` §5, §8) | `200` (may create `Pending`) | `400`; `403` |
| API ← Desktop | `PATCH /api/payouts/{id}/status` | `{ "status": "…" }` — allowed: `Pending`/`InProgress`/`Sent`/`Failed`/`Cancelled` per **`docs/SPEC.md` §3** (includes **`InProgress` → `Pending`** escape hatch) | `200` | `400` `terminal_status_change_not_allowed`; `403`; `404` `not_found` |
| API ← Desktop | `POST /api/payouts/{id}/confirm-acceptance` | `{ "characterName": string }` (**required**) | `200` (acceptance recorded; not `Sent`) | `403`; `404` |
| API ← Desktop | Mail-send path | Desktop derives from log → `PATCH` → `Sent` | `200` | same as PATCH |

> Desktop **does not** consume a Backend push channel in MVP docs; **polling** is implied.

### WPF Desktop App → WoW Client (WinAPI / PostMessage)

| Direction | Message/Endpoint | Payload shape | Success response | Failure response |
|-----------|------------------|---------------|------------------|------------------|
| Desktop → WoW | Win32 focus + **PostMessage** (primary) | Window handle + chat/input messages carrying **`/run NotifyWinnerWhisper("uuid","Name")`**, **`/run ReceiveGold("…")`**, or **`/who Name`** text | Game executes; addon/Lua runs | Wrong HWND; focus timing; anti-cheat block |
| Desktop → WoW | **SendInput** (fallback) | OS input synthesize | Same | User-configured fallback failures |
| WoW → Desktop | (no direct callback) | — | — | — |

### WoW Client → WoW Addon (Lua)

| Direction | Message/Endpoint | Payload shape | Success response | Failure response |
|-----------|------------------|---------------|------------------|------------------|
| Client → Addon | Global `NotifyWinnerWhisper(payoutId, characterName)` | via **`/run`** from Desktop (`docs/SPEC.md` §8–9) | §9 **`/whisper`** sent by addon | Bad args; WoW limits |
| Client → Addon | Global `ReceiveGold(dataString)` | semicolon entries: `UUID:CharacterName:GoldCopper;` | Queued mail prep | Parse error; invalid delimiters |
| Client → Addon | **MAIL_SHOW** (event) | (FrameXML) | Side panel + queue UX | Events not fired if wrong hook |
| Client → Addon | Whisper events | sender + text matching **`!twgold`** (case-insensitive) | Print **`[MGM_ACCEPT:UUID]`** to chat | Wrong event registration on 3.3.5a |
| Addon → Client | Chat print **`[MGM_WHO]`** + JSON / `[MGM_ACCEPT:UUID]` / `[MGM_CONFIRM:UUID]` | string | lines in `WoWChatLog.txt` | Wrong tag; mail not sent → no **CONFIRM** |
| Addon → **Chat log** | **`[MGM_WHO]`** + JSON (`docs/SPEC.md` §8) | `/who` parse result | Desktop tail **`WoWChatLog.txt`** → **`POST /api/roulette/verify-candidate`** | Line missing; parse failure |

### WoW Addon → WPF Desktop App → ASP.NET Core API

| Direction | Message/Endpoint | Payload shape | Success response | Failure response |
|-----------|------------------|---------------|------------------|------------------|
| Addon → Desktop | **`[MGM_WHO]`** in **`Logs\WoWChatLog.txt`** (`docs/SPEC.md` §8) | `/who` result for **`verify-candidate`** | Desktop **`POST /api/roulette/verify-candidate`** | Log path wrong; stale **`spinCycleId`** |
| Addon → Desktop | **`[MGM_ACCEPT:UUID]`** in `Logs\WoWChatLog.txt` | addon prints after Lua whisper match | Desktop **confirm-acceptance** | Log path wrong; tag missing |
| Desktop → API | `POST /api/payouts/{id}/confirm-acceptance` | JSON body + ApiKey | `200` | `403`, `404`, validation |
| Desktop → API | `PATCH /api/payouts/{id}/status` `Sent` | after **`[MGM_CONFIRM:UUID]`** in `Logs\WoWChatLog.txt` | `200` | transition errors |
| Desktop | Manual **Mark as Sent** | operator override | same PATCH path | audit note |

---

**Document maintenance:** If **`[MGM_ACCEPT]`** / **`[MGM_CONFIRM]`** log formats change, update regexes in Desktop and **`docs/SPEC.md` §10**. **Pool/spin** routes: `docs/SPEC.md` §5.1 (`GET /api/roulette/state`, `GET /api/pool/me`).
